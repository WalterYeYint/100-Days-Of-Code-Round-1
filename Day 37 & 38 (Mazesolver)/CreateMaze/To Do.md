# To Do

### Data Structure

1. Can two Vertex share the same Edge 
   - Less memory 
   - Order of coordinates becomes problematic
2. Create new function to reduce nodes
   - Can remove vertexes of degree three that connect to vertexes of degree one 
3. Make number of pair of directions variable 	
   - Can allow for diaganol movement
   - Potentially can move away from solving on standard mazes

### Path Finding 

1. Make getting coordinates faster
   - Store edges
   - Cannot store beginning Vertex
2. Need to update A*
   - To handle bad heuristics
   - Separate A*s implementation from Dijkstra
3. Add more path finding algorithms
   - Wall Traversal
   - Best First Search
4. Remove modified path finding and instead have an option to save Vertexes visited
   - Easier to expand on
   - Extra condition statement evaluated at every Vertex  

### Others

1. Add use of images as an example
2. Make animation generic
   - Iterate through maze and place walls
3. Move to a GUI interface
